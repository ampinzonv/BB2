# @brief converts a fastq file to a fasta format (compressed or uncompressed in GZ format).
# @description Transforms a fastq file into a fasta file.
# if only the fastq file argument is given it outputs the fasta format in STDOUT.
# This input file can be compressed in gz format.
# If a second (optional) argument is given (a string containing the desired name for FASTA output file)
# STDOUT is then redirected to a file. If the string has a ".gz" extension, the output is also compressed.
# 
#
# @example
#   BBfile_fastq_to_fasta "./file.fastq[.gz]" 
#   #Output
#   file in FASTA format in STDOUT
#   
#   #Example 2
#   BBfile_fastq_to_fasta "./file.fastq[.gz]"  file.fa[.gz]

# @brief Splits a multiple fasta file into single sequences.
# @description Splits a multiple fasta file into single sequences, where
# each sequence file is named using input file name and the description in the header fasta.
#  If an outdir is not defined, a directory is created and named after the input file name
# plus the .singles extension. If input is a compressed file, each outputed individual file is also compressed.
# PLEASE notice that this function ALWAYS OUTPUTS to the current directory, even if you define the output
# as a complete path. For example a command like:
#
# BBfile::multiple_fasta_to_singles input.fa /home/andres/outputs
#
# Will put the single files in ./home/andres/outputs so it will create the whole directory tree
# from ./home to outputs and put the files there.
#
# @example
#   cat file.fasta
#   >A
#   AGCT
#   >B
#   TTTT
#
#
#   BBfile_multiple_fasta_to_singles "./file.fasta[.gz]" 
#   #Output
#   file.fasta[.gz].singles/clear
#       file.part_A.fasta[.gz]
#       file.part_B.fasta[.gz]

    # This is not a trivial problem. actually A,C,G and T are also part of protein
    # sequences and it is hard to tell which is which with high confidence.
    # This link shows the discussion about it:  https://www.biostars.org/p/82471/
    #
    # So it seems that the best approach is to check for the general sequence content
    # over a pre-defined window of "n" bases.

    # Overall the algorithm to asses this could be something like:

    # 0) Ommit fasta header
    # 1) asses sequence length = TSL
    # 2) Start reading each base from position 1 towards the end (or a pre-defined threshold)
    # 3) count any occurrence of A, G, C OR T  until end or pre-defined threshold.
    # 4) if any of the following characters (E, F, I, L, P, or Q) appears then break. It is a PROTEIN!***
    # 5) If end is reached and A+G+C+T = TSL, most probably this is a Nucleotide sequence.
    
    
    # According to the official IUPAC code:
    # ***
    # http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html
    # E, F, I, L, P, and Q are exclusive for proteins. On the other hand the letter "B" is exclusive
    # to nucleotide sequences.
