### Why
HTML has CSS, Unix-like shells have ANSI/VT100 Control Sequences. SHML makes is easy to apply style to your shell scripts without trying to remember that **yellow** is `\033[33m` instead it's `$(color yellow)`.

### 1-liner Install
```bash
# Unix-like
$ sudo bash -c 'curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odb/shml/1.1.0/shml.sh -o /usr/local/bin/shml && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shml'

# Homebrew
$ brew install shml

# npm
$ npm install -g shml
```
