* hepatitis_delta_virus.fa
Whole genome sequence of Hepatitis Delta virus as downloaded from RefSeq.

* hepatitis_virus_raw_reads.fq.gz
Simulated interleaved Raw fastq data for hepatitis_delta_virus.fa genome.
This was achieved as follows:

$BIOBASH_BIN/all/bbmap/randomreads.sh \
reads=500000 \
length=120 \
paired interleaved  \
q=35 \
out=hepatitis_virus_raw_reads.fq.gz

Use this data along with the hepatitis genome for testing assembly. Note that this is
still PAIRED END sequencing but in interleaved format.

(NOTE: the shred.sh script can also be used to achieve a similar behaviour:
Check: https://www.seqanswers.com/forum/bioinformatics/bioinformatics-aa/46985-yes-bbmap-can-do-that?t=58221)

hepatitis_virus_raw_reads1.fq.gz and hepatitis_virus_raw_reads2.fq.gz are the same hepatitis_virus_raw_reads.fq.gz
but in two independent files, one for forward reads and the other for reverse ones. This files were obtained 
using seqkit as follows:

BIOBASH_BIN_OS/seqkit split2 -p 2 ../BB2/testdata/hepatitis_virus_raw_reads.fq.gz


* wholegenome.fasta
SARS-CoV2 whole genome sequence. Deprecated, for testing better use hepatitis_delta_virus.fa
since it is smaller. Keep it here for backward compatibility with some BB testing.

* testblastdb
BLAST database created with the hepatitis_delta_virus genome using bb_make_blast_db.


* BlastdbProt
BLAST database created with the hepatitis_delta_virus genome using bb_make_blast_db, PREVIOUSLY translated
into proteins using "seqkit translate".

* hepatitis_delta_virus_fragments
Are two random subsequences take fromthe hepatitis_delta_virus genome in this same folder.
Is mainly used for testing blast.
